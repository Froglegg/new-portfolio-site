              <p> I'm a MERN-stack developer with a firm grasp on the latest tools and technologies for developing and driving a sucessful digital product. I've developed and built sites for Enterprise-scale companies as well as smaller NGO's as a full-time employee and freelance contractor. I love full-stack because I enjoy every stage and aspect of development, from building MVC architecture to refining UI. I particularly enjoy the ideation and discovery process, and working alongside clients and colleagues to optimize site UX and CX based on their business requirements and content strategy.
