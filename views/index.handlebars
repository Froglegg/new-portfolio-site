              <p> Experienced full-stack engineer with a firm grasp on MERN-stack (MongoDB / MySQL, Express, React.js, Node.js) development. I've developed web sites and applications for Enterprise-scale companies as well as smaller NGO's as a full-time employee and contractor. I'm big into test-driven development, modern MVC application architecture, modularity and object oriented programming. I love learning new stuff and tinkering.

                <p>I've developed and built sites for Enterprise-scale companies as well as smaller NGO's as a full-time employee and freelance contractor. I love full-stack because I enjoy every stage and aspect of development, from building MVC architecture to refining UI. I particularly enjoy the ideation and discovery process, and working alongside clients and colleagues to optimize site UX and CX based on their business requirements and content strategy.</p>
                <p>I also love backpacking and making music :)</p>
