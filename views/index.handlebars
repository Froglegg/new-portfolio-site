              <p> Experienced full-stack engineer with a firm grasp on JavaScript and MERN (MongoDB / MySQL, Express, React.js, Node.js) development. I've built web sites and applications for Enterprise-scale companies as well as smaller NGO's as a full-time employee and contractor.

<p>
I love full-stack because I enjoy every stage and aspect of development, from building MVC architecture, server routes, database models, API layers, to developing functional UI. I particularly enjoy the ideation and discovery process, and working with clients and colleagues to build the perfect digital product.</p>
