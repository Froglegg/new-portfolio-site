              <p> I am a full stack engineer with 3+ years’ professional and academic experience in web development. I’m skilled at MERN stack development (MongoDB / MySQL, Express, React.js, Node.js), and am an eloquent JavaScript programmer. I'm big into test-driven development, modern MVC application architecture, modularity and object oriented programming. I love learning new stuff and tinkering.
                </p>
                <p>I've developed and built sites for Enterprise-scale companies as well as smaller NGO's as a full-time employee and freelance contractor. I love full-stack because I enjoy every stage and aspect of development, from building MVC architecture to refining UI. I particularly enjoy the ideation and discovery process, and working alongside clients and colleagues to optimize site UX and CX based on their business requirements and content strategy.</p>
                <p>I also love backpacking and making music :)</p>
